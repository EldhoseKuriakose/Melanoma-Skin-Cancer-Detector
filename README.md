# Melanoma-Skin-Cancer-Detector

Melanoma is a threatening skin cancer which prevails in nowadays. So this is a python based application to detect melanoma early using scanning and testing the images of lesion parts with the system. CNN architecture is created and trained with melanoma and non melanoma images. Then system predicts whether the test image contains melanoma or not by comparing features with the trained set.

1. Clone the repository to the system
2. Open the terminal in the project location
3. `To run the program` python index.py

##### Types of users

1. `Admin` - Has the the privilage to train the system and generate the result.
    - Username - admin
    - Password - admin
2. `users` - Can check the image with system to identify whether it contains melanoma or not.
    - Can sign in after creating an account

The accuracy of the system can be increased by training the system with more different melanoma and non melanoma images.

###### Technologies used

Python, Tkinter, keras, tensorflow
